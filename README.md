## Exp 8: Reproducing an Image Using Prompts for Image Generation

# Date : 14.10.2025
# Reg. No.: 212222080013

## Aim:
To demonstrate how text-to-image generation tools can reproduce an existing image by creating detailed and accurate prompts. This experiment focuses on identifying the important visual features of two given images and generating new images that closely resemble the originals.

## Procedure:
IMAGE 1 — Example: A Brown Dog in a Park
Step 1: Analyze the Given Image

Original Image Description:
A brown dog sitting in a park.

Key elements identified:

Object/Subject: One brown dog

Colors: Brown fur, green grass

Textures: Soft short fur, grassy ground

Lighting: Bright natural sunlight

Background: Trees, open park space

Composition: Dog centered, eye-level view

Style: Realistic outdoor photograph

Step 2: Create the Basic Prompt

“A brown dog sitting in a park.”

Step 3: Refine the Prompt

“A brown dog sitting on green grass in a sunny park.”

Step 4: Add Style and Artistic Detail

“A realistic outdoor photograph of a brown dog sitting on green grass in a sunny park.”

Step 5: Fine-Tune the Prompt

Final Detailed Prompt for Image 1:
“A highly realistic outdoor photo of a brown dog sitting on bright green grass in a sunny park, with natural daylight, soft shadows on the ground, and blurred trees in the background.”

Step 6: Generate the Image

Use DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, or MidJourney with the final prompt.

Step 7: Compare With the Original

Similarities:

Correct dog color

Outdoor park setting

Grass and lighting mostly accurate

Differences:

Background tree layout may vary

Dog pose may slightly differ

Adjustment Prompt:
“A medium-sized short-haired brown dog, facing forward, with a relaxed sitting pose.”

IMAGE 2 — Example: A Coffee Cup With a Sugar Cube
Step 1: Analyze the Given Image

Original Image Description:
A cup of coffee with a sugar cube beside it.

Key elements identified:

Objects: Coffee cup, sugar cube

Colors: Dark brown coffee, white cup, white/beige sugar cube

Textures: Smooth ceramic cup, grainy sugar cube

Lighting: Soft indoor light

Background: Wooden or flat surface

Composition: Cup centered, sugar cube close by

Style: Simple realistic tabletop photography

Step 2: Basic Prompt

“A cup of coffee with a sugar cube.”

Step 3: Refine the Prompt

“A white cup filled with dark coffee with a sugar cube placed beside it.”

Step 4: Add Style and Artistic Detail

“A realistic indoor photograph of a white coffee cup with a sugar cube beside it.”

Step 5: Fine-Tune the Prompt

Final Detailed Prompt for Image 2:
“A realistic tabletop photo of a white ceramic cup filled with hot dark coffee, placed on a wooden surface with a single sugar cube beside the cup, illuminated by soft warm indoor lighting.”

Step 6: Generate the Image

Use DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, or MidJourney with the final prompt.

Step 7: Compare With the Original

Similarities:

Coffee color

Sugar cube placement

White ceramic cup

Soft lighting

Differences:

Wood texture may differ

Cup shape may need refinement

## Tools/LLMs for Image Generation:
DALL·E – high realism and detail

Stable Diffusion – flexible and customizable

MidJourney – high-quality artistic visuals

## Deliverables:
Original Image 1: Brown dog in a park

Generated Image 1: Using the final refined dog prompt

Original Image 2: Coffee with a sugar cube

Generated Image 2: Using the final refined coffee prompt

Prompts Used:

Basic

Refined

Style

Final version

Comparison Report:
Similarities, differences, corrections

Conclusion

## Conclusion:
By analyzing each image carefully and crafting detailed prompts, AI text-to-image models can generate images very close to the original. The experiment shows that:

Basic prompts give rough outputs

Refined prompts improve accuracy

Detailed, specific prompts create the closest match

This demonstrates the importance of prompt engineering and iteration when working with text-to-image tools.
